# logic is to use the 'backtrack' algorithm to solve any solvable sudoku puzzle
# steps: 1. find the first (rows then cols) unsolved space (denoted by 0 in the board)
# 2. try valid numbers [1-9] 3. pick first one that works (checking against row, col, and square).
# 4. repeat. 5. If location has no possible valid solution, backtrack

# backtrack in this case means to go to the previously solved location and go to the next valid number and continue.
# if the previous location has no valid number, go to one before that. Keep repeating until continuing results in
# a correctly solved board
