    "After three consecutive years with less snowfall in January in Waterloo, the mayor is considering reducing expenses with snow plowing equipment. Currently, the city can handle plowing up to 3 cm of snow per day from public areas. The mayor requested a study that indicated that a 33% reduction (i.e., to 2 cm of snow per day) of plowing capacity in January would save $500,000. However, another independent study also indicates that when street plowing is inefficient fewer people leave their homes, leading to an economic impact of \\$50,000/day with insufficient snow plowing.\n",
    "Suggested steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Calculate the amount of snow, say S, on the ground each day considering (i) how much snow fell today, and (ii) the backlog of snow plowing from previous days, which is a function of the plowing capacity C.\n",
    "*   For each day where S > 0, it will cost $50,000 for the city.\n",
    "*   Run multiple realizations and calculate the total loss per realization, i.e., the sum of the losses across all days of January.\n",
    "*   Run 2 scenarios, one where C=3 and one where C=2.\n",
    "*   Determine the differences in costs and losses between the scenarios and make a recommendation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: this problem is meant to make extensive use of the SYDE599_Simulations colab notebook provided to you during Week 4. Consequently, we will assume that snowfall = snow accumulated on the ground. That is, we are ignoring snow melting from any sources and we are assuming that snow falls evenly- that is, 1 cm of snow fall = 1 cm of snow that must be plowed off the streets."

    "In this problem, you will strengthen your understanding of agent-based simulation via object-oriented programming by build a game of fetch similar to the one created in class. The rules are similar: animals are randomly placed on a 50x50 units field; each animal has a speed and; the animals’ speed determines if they can get a treat that is randomly placed in field.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suggested steps:\n",
    "1. Create the Animal class, give it the class variables (i.e., or attributes) and class functions (i.e., behaviours) as shown in Fig. 1.\n",
    "2. Create the Air Animal, Land Animal, and Water Animal classes. These classes must inherit the attributes and behaviours of Animal. Each type of animal also has a unique attribute and behaviour related to its speed under certain conditions.\n",
    "    a. The Air Animals class represents a generic animal that can fly. The flight speed of a generic Air Animal is flight_speed ~ N(5,2.5). However, Air Animals can only fly if the sky is not foggy.\n",
    "    b. The Land Animals class represents a generic animal that can walk on land. The walk speed depends on the terrain. If the terrain is ‘Land’, the walk speed of a generic Land Animal is walk_speed ~ N(5,2.5). If the terrain is ‘Sand’, the walk_speed is reduced by 50%. If the terrain is ‘Water’, the walk_speed is zero.\n",
    "    c. The Water Animals class represent a generic animal that can swim. The swim speed speed is swim_speed ~ N(5,2.5) if the terrain is ‘Water’ and zero otherwise.\n",
    "3. Next, create a class for each animal.\n",
    "    a. The Dog is a Land Animal, and its walk_speed is the same as that of a Land Animal.\n",
    "    b. The Seal is a Land Animal and a Water Animal. However, the Seal’s walk_speed is 30% of that of a generic Land Animal, and the Seal’s swim speed is 200% of that of a generic Water Animal.\n",
    "    c. The Goose is a Land Animal and Water Animal and Air Animal. However, the Goose’s walk_speed is 30% of that of a generic Land Animal, the Goose’s swim_speed is 30% of that of a generic Water Animal, and the Goose’s flight speed the same of a generic Air Animal.\n",
    "4. Instantiate 10 animals of each class.\n",
    "5. Simulate 60 games of fetch. Exactly 30 games should be on foggy days and exactly 30 should not. Exactly 20 games should be on land, sand, and water each. In each game, one animal from each group of 10 is selected to play.\n",
    "6. Plot the results of the 60 games on a X-Y plot where the abscissa is the number of games played so far and the ordinate shows the points for each animal, i.e., dogs, seals, and geese."
